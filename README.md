# One Word Imposter

A fun, fast-paced social deduction game where one player is the imposter — and they don't know the secret word!

## Why I Created This

I love party games that bring people together, but I noticed most existing "liar" or "imposter" style games weren't accessible to groups with mixed languages. I wanted to create something simple that anyone could pick up in seconds, regardless of their native language.

One Word Imposter is designed for spontaneous fun — no app downloads required for web play, no complicated rules, just pick a category and start playing.

## Multi-Language Accessibility

One of the core features is the **built-in translation system**. Players can switch the entire UI and secret words into:

- 🇨🇳 Chinese (Simplified)
- 🇪🇸 Spanish
- 🇫🇷 French
- 🇩🇪 German
- 🇯🇵 Japanese
- 🇰🇷 Korean
- 🇸🇦 Arabic
- 🇮🇳 Hindi

This makes the game truly inclusive — whether you're playing with family who speak different languages, international friends, or using it as a fun language learning tool.

## Play Anywhere

**🌐 Web App:** Play instantly in any browser at [onewordimposter.onrender.com](https://onewordimposter.onrender.com)

**📱 Mobile App:** Available as a native Android app for offline play and a smoother mobile experience.

## How It Works

1. Choose the number of players (3–20)
2. Pick a category (Foods, Animals, Famous People, Countries, and many more)
3. Pass the device around — each player sees their role privately
4. One person is the imposter and must bluff their way through
5. Give hints, discuss, and vote to find the liar!
